<h1>Basic Google latitude App - with oAuth (JSO)</h1>

<p>I wanted to build a basic maps app using google latitude data, this involves the same OAuth 
	process as used by Facebook, Instagram and loads of other social networks.</p>

<p>There are issues with safari and IE, they suffer a infinite loop once you receive the token, 
	this is a issue with Andreas Solbergs JSO project on github and it needs looking into or 
	bypassing completely, when i find the time this is what i will do as Andreas has ignored my communication (you can't blame him)</p>

<p>Other than that it seems fine you can find a demo on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.method7.co.uk/latitude">method7.co.uk/latitiude</a></p>
